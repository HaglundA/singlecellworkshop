This repository contains materials for the Imperial MSc Genomic Medicine single-cell workshop (May 2023).

In this workshop, we will analyse a single-cell dataset published on PBMCs.


By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to;


1. Download public single-cell data
2. Create a single-cell object using the "Seurat" library in R
3. Perform qualitative analysis and exploration prior to quality control
4. Normalize the data and understand why it is necessary
5. Clustering cells using PCA and UMAP
6. Annotate cells based on marker gene expression
7. Perform differential expression analysis at single-cell level
